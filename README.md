## Understanding Confidence Intervals

When you make an estimate in statistics, whether it is a summary statistic or a test statistic, there is always uncertainty around that estimate because the number is based on a sample of the population you are studying.

The confidence interval is the range of values that you expect your estimate to fall between a certain percentage of the time if you run your experiment again or re-sample the population in the same way.

The confidence level is the percentage of times you expect to reproduce an estimate between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval, and is set by the alpha value.

The alpha value, or the threshold for statistical significance, is arbitrary ‚Äì which value you use depends on your field of study.

In most cases, researchers use an alpha of 0.05, which means that there is a less than 5% chance that the data being tested could have occurred under the null hypothesis.

### What exactly is a confidence interval?
A confidence interval is the mean of your estimate plus and minus the variation in that estimate. This is the range of values you expect your estimate to fall between if you redo your test, within a certain level of confidence.

Confidence, in statistics, is another way to describe probability. For example, if you construct a confidence interval with a 95% confidence level, you are confident that 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval.

Your desired confidence level is usually one minus the alpha ( $\alpha$ ) value you used in your statistical test:

Confidence level = 1 ‚àí $\alpha$

So if you use an alpha value of p < 0.05 for statistical significance, then your confidence level would be 1 ‚àí 0.05 = 0.95, or 95%.

When do you use confidence intervals?
You can calculate confidence intervals for many kinds of statistical estimates, including:

+ Proportions
+ Population means
+ Differences between population means or proportions
+ Estimates of variation among groups

These are all point estimates, and don‚Äôt give any information about the variation around the number. Confidence intervals are useful for communicating the variation around a point estimate.

### Calculating a confidence interval: what you need to know
Most statistical programs will include the confidence interval of the estimate when you run a statistical test.

If you want to calculate a confidence interval on your own, you need to know:

A.) The point estimate you are constructing the confidence interval for
B.) The critical values for the test statistic
C.) The standard deviation of the sample
D.) The sample size

Once you know each of these components, you can calculate the confidence interval for your estimate by plugging them into the confidence interval formula that corresponds to your data.

Point estimate
The point estimate of your confidence interval will be whatever statistical estimate you are making (e.g. population mean, the difference between population means, proportions, variation among groups).

Finding the critical value
Critical values tell you how many standard deviations away from the mean you need to go in order to reach the desired confidence level for your confidence interval.

There are three steps to find the critical value.

Choose your alpha ( $\alpha$ ) value.
The alpha value is the probability threshold for statistical significance. The most common alpha value is p = 0.05, but 0.1, 0.01, and even 0.001 are sometimes used. It‚Äôs best to look at the papers published in your field to decide which alpha value to use.

Decide if you need a one-tailed interval or a two-tailed interval.
You will most likely use a two-tailed interval unless you are doing a one-tailed t-test.

For a two-tailed interval, divide your $\alpha$ alpha by two to get the alpha value for the upper and lower tails.

Look up the critical value that corresponds with the alpha value.
If your data follows a normal distribution, or if you have a large sample size (n > 30) that is approximately normally distributed, you can use the z-distribution to find your critical values.

For a z-statistic, some of the most common values are shown in this table:

If you are using a small dataset (n ‚â§ 30) that is approximately normally distributed, use the t-distribution instead.

The t-distribution follows the same shape as the z-distribution, but corrects for small sample sizes. For the t-distribution, you need to know your degrees of freedom (sample size minus 1).

For normal distributions, like the t-distribution and z-distribution, the critical value is the same on either side of the mean.

### Caution when using confidence intervals
Confidence intervals are sometimes interpreted as saying that the ‚Äòtrue value‚Äô of your estimate lies within the bounds of the confidence interval.

This is not the case. The confidence interval cannot tell you how likely it is that you found the true value of your statistical estimate because it is based on a sample, not on the whole population.

The confidence interval only tells you what range of values you can expect to find if you re-do your sampling or run your experiment again in the exact same way.

The more accurate your sampling plan, or the more realistic your experiment, the greater the chance that your confidence interval includes the true value of your estimate. But this accuracy is determined by your research methods, not by the statistics you do after you have collected the data!

Chi Square - Goodness of Fit
A shop owner claims that an equal number of customers come into his shop each weekday. To test this hypothesis, a researcher records the number of customers that come into the shop in a given week and finds the following:

Monday: 50 customers
Tuesday: 60 customers
Wednesday: 40 customers
Thursday: 47 customers
Friday: 53 customers
Null Hypothesis There is no significant difference between the observed and the expected values.

Alternate Hypothesis There is a significant difference between the observed and the expected values.
