Question:
A cartwheeling competition was organized for some adults. The data looks like following,
(80.57, 98.96, 85.28, 83.83, 69.94, 89.59, 91.09, 66.25, 91.21, 82.7 , 73.54, 81.99, 54.01, 82.89, 75.88, 98.32,107.2 , 85.53, 79.08, 84.3 , 89.32, 86.35, 78.98, 92.26, 87.01)
Is the average cartwheel distance (in inches) for adults more than 80 inches?
Null Hypothesis: 𝜇 = 80
Alternative Hypthosis: 𝜇 > 80

You want to test an American citizen's claim that the average height of an American is 175.3 cm. Measure the heights of ten American males and use the T-test to determine if the American’s claim is true.

Null Hypothesis: 𝜇1 = 175
Alternative Hypthosis: 𝜇1≠ 175

Question

In previous years, 52% of parents believed that electronics and social media was the cause of their teenager’s lack of sleep. Do more parents today believe that their teenager’s lack of sleep is caused due to electronics and social media?

Question

Considering adults in the NHANES data, do males have a significantly different from the mean Body Mass Index of females?

Null Hypothesis: 𝜇1=𝜇2
Alternative Hypthosis: 𝜇1≠𝜇2

Research Question

Is there a significant difference between the population proportions of parents of black children and parents of Hispanic children who report that their child has had some swimming lessons? Data: 247 Parents of Black Children. 36.8% of parents report that their child has had some swimming lessons. 308 Parents of Hispanic Children. 38.9% of parents report that their child has had some swimming lessons.

Null Hypothesis: p1 - p2 = 0
Alternative Hypthosis: p1 - p2 ≠ 0

Chi Square - Goodness of Fit
A shop owner claims that an equal number of customers come into his shop each weekday. To test this hypothesis, a researcher records the number of customers that come into the shop in a given week and finds the following:

Monday: 50 customers
Tuesday: 60 customers
Wednesday: 40 customers
Thursday: 47 customers
Friday: 53 customers
Null Hypothesis There is no significant difference between the observed and the expected values.

Alternate Hypothesis There is a significant difference between the observed and the expected values.
